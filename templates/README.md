# Templates

This folder contains image templates for people to start their islands with. Download and upload one of these to the site to start off with a template. This is a temporary feature until @eugeneration adds templates.

## How to use templates?

Open the [Happy Island Designer app](https://flynnfarrow.github.io/HappyIslandDesigner) and click the menu button then open. Make sure you download the images as well! I'm planning to add embed pictures in a webpage so you can easily download them and in the future possibly even open them without downloading it!
